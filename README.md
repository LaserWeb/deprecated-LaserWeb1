## Serial baud rate

Your Marlin based lasercutter should be configured to use a baud rate of 115200, you can set that in Configuration.h for Marlin.  You can also modify the RepRapWeb config.js to change it's speed.


## Installation Instructions


## Windows

On Windows 7 and above, please use the following instructions. We are assuming from a vanilla Windows installation so your mileage may vary depending on things you already have installed. If you find conflicts, please let us know via a GitHub Issue

1. Starting with a vanilla Windows 7 (or higher, should be fine) installation
2. Download and Install the **free** [Windows SDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279) and select every option (you can unselect options if you absolutely know what you are doing by unselecting them, but it is easier just to select all options).
3. Download and install Node.js version node-v0.12.7 (NOTE:  At the time of writing SerialPort is not supported on Node,js 4.0+) from https://nodejs.org/download/release/v0.12.7/
4. Install [Python 2.7.5](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/) for any questions, please refer to their [FAQ](http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html). Default settings are perfect.
5. Open the Windows SDK 7.1 Command prompt (this allows the C++ compiler to be available on the path). You might have to run the command prompt as Administrator
6. Enter the following command in the prompt which adds Python to the path (the Python installed doesn't do this for you).<pre>set path=%path%;C:\Python27</pre>
7. Open a command prompt and 'cd' to where you want to install LaserWeb (for example 'cd c:\users\Peter\Desktop')
8.  git clone https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb.git
9.  cd LaserWeb
10.  npm install


## Ubuntu

1. Open a terminal
2. Enter the following command
```sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm build-essential git```
3. Go to the directory you would like to install LaserWeb in by entering ```cd Desktop``` for example
4. Enter ```git clone https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb.git``` then ```cd LaserWeb```
5. Next install the npm modules by entering the following```
npm install serialport
npm install socket.io
npm install node-static```
6. Finally enter ```nodejs server.js```


## Mac OS X

1. Download and install nodejs version node-v0.12.7 (NOTE:  At the time of writing SerialPort is not supported on Node,js 4.0+) from https://nodejs.org/download/release/v0.12.7/    Note2: Compiling SerialPort sometimes fails. Read the auhors blog post about why its hard to manage over at http://www.voodootikigod.com/on-maintaining-a-native-node-module/
2. ```cd``` to a directory to put LaserWeb in
3. Open a terminal and enter ```git clone https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb.git```
4. Enter ```cd LaserWeb``` in the terminal window
5. Enter ```npm install```
6. Now you can start it with ```node server.js```

## Config

edit config.js to change serial baud rate and web port
edit /i/gcode-viewer/ui.js to change size of your laser's bed

## Running

// standalone
```
node server.js
```

// with forever
```
npm install -g forever
forever start server.js
```

## Access

The default port in config.js is 8000, you can change it by editing the file.

http://hostaddress:8000/

## Timelapse

There is a bash script names rrw_timelapse.sh in this repository which you can run on a Linux or BSD machine to generate a timelapse from the built in RRW Webcam server.
